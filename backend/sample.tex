% \subsection{The Rise and Challenges of Deep Neural Networks}
Deep neural networks have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, achieving unprecedented performance in a wide range of tasks, from image recognition \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet} to natural language processing \cite{devlin2018bert}. Despite their remarkable success, these models often remain enigmatic, functioning as ``black boxes'' that transform inputs into outputs through a complex series of non-linear operations \cite{}. This opacity poses significant challenges for researchers and practitioners, as it hinders our ability to fully understand and optimize these powerful systems\cite{}.

At the heart of the deep learning paradigm lies the concept of signal propagationâ€”the journey of information as it flows through the layers of a neural network during both forward and backward passes~\cite{glorot2010understanding}. Understanding this process is crucial for several reasons. It provides insights into how neural networks process and transform information, potentially illuminating the principles underlying their decision-making processes~\cite{zeiler2014visualizing}. A deeper understanding of signal propagation can guide the design of more efficient and effective network architectures~\cite{he2016deep}. It informs the development of better optimization algorithms and training procedures~\cite{kingma2014adam}. Finally, it contributes to the broader goal of making neural networks more principled and efficient~\cite{}.
